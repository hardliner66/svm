# SVM

## Vision

Create a highly interactive VM that lets the user interact with the code and state of the
VM in many interesting ways.

## Ideas

### Image Based

The VM should be a live and interactive runtime environment, offering the user the flexibility to
play around and change things without having to recompile or even restart the VM.

### FUSE

Map the internal state of the VM onto the file system, making it possible to explore the state
with just the use of basic unix file commands.
